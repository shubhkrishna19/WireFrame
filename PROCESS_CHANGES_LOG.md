# 📋 Process Changes Log

**This file tracks any changes to the coordination process between Cursor AI and Cline AI.**

**⚠️ If I change the process, I will update this file and notify you explicitly.**

---

## Current Process (As of 2025-01-13)

### Setup:
1. User reads `PROMPT_FOR_CLINE.md`
2. User copies exact prompt from that file
3. User gives prompt to Cline AI in VS Code
4. Cline reads coordination files
5. Cline starts working on tasks
6. Cline updates CHANGELOG.md after every change
7. I (Cursor AI) review progress in CHANGELOG.md

### Key Files:
- `PROMPT_FOR_CLINE.md` - Exact prompt for user to give Cline
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Shared communication file (both AIs update)
- `TASK_STATUS.json` - Task tracking
- `TASKS_FOR_CLINE.md` - Task list for Cline

## Process Changes

### [2025-01-13] - Initial Setup
**Status:** Active  
**Process:** User must explicitly give Cline the prompt from PROMPT_FOR_CLINE.md. Cline will not automatically read files. User must remind Cline to update CHANGELOG.md.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **I will NOT change the process without notifying you**
- **If process changes, I will update this file**
- **You will need to give Cline updated instructions if process changes**
- **Always check PROMPT_FOR_CLINE.md for current prompt**
